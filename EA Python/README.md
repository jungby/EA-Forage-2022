### The Revenge of Pacman

This is an adaptation of hbokmann's code designed for Electronic Arts USA, which needed some changes, not only to the original code but also to make the different version that is being asked for.

It has two versions but only one difference between them; the first one has the original ghosts (colored ones) and the second one has only numb blue ghosts.

# Changes (adaptation)

* Pac-Man can kill a ghost if he comes into contact with it or viceversa
* Each ghost that has not yet been hit multiplies itself every 30 seconds
* Pac-man needs to collect every point before the ghosts before the number of ghosts grows to 32 times the original number (128 ghosts)

# Minor changes (from the original)

* Changed the icon
* Changed the background music to Slider - Kōji Kondō (Part of Mario 64 OST)
* Changed the type of font, size and its color
* Replaced the colored ghost with pixel ones
* Added numb blue ghosts

# To change

* Make different files with the classes to make the main file more readable
* Replace the troll man player to the actual Pac-Man (animated)
* Continue to clean up the code

### Pacman in Python with PyGame

This is a very minimal implementation of the Pacman game, having only one level and without ghosts strategy, not even with random movements (yes, the routes are programmed). However, we may improve this game in the future and everyone else interested can feel free to fork and contribute to this project.

# Future development

* Fix Pacman's movement
* Ghosts moving algorithm and artificial intelligence
* Better design
* Better algorithm for the walls
* Additional levels?


Tested with [PyGame 1.9](http://pygame.org/ftp/pygame-1.9.2a0.win32-py3.2.msi ) and [Python 3.2 32bit](http://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.2.3/python-3.2.3.msi)
